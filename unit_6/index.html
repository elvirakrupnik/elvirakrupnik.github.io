	<h3 id="slogan"><i>Hi, I am a designer, but I have other interests as well.</i></h3>

	<p><b>I have a wide variety of interests and designing is the wave I have decided to ride. I love blogging and I love websites and learning how they are built. Not only that I want to educate people I meet, and learn from people. Art creation comes from experiences, and whether it is writing or making, life is my true passion. And an important part of life is people --- spirituality, and I have always loved all types of creative people. This generation is built behind artists, dreamers, piraters, and all types of people who ultimately came to the conlcusion of wanting to be better than the last. We are the ones who came to improve upon what is already here. Most things have already been invented, so we improve and advance and continue legacies. 

	My interests include educating and inspiring others. I aspire to start a blog to house all my works. I studied graphic design at Mason Gross and have won awards for my design and artwork and continue to instill and practice excellence in all the work I do. Employers looking for the following:</b>
